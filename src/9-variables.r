#A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. 
#A variable in R can store an atomic vector, group of atomic vectors or a combination 
#of many Robjects. A valid variable name consists of letters, numbers and the dot 
#or underline characters. The variable name starts with a letter or the dot not followed 
#by a number.


"Variable Assignment"
#The variables can be assigned values using leftward, rightward and equal to operator. The values 
#of the variables can be printed using print() or cat()function. The cat() function combines 
#multiple items into a continuous print output.

# Assignment using equal operator.
var.1 = c(0,1,2,3)           

# Assignment using leftward operator.
var.2 <- c("Jatin","Chauhan")   

# Assignment using rightward operator.
#(The vector c(TRUE,1) has a mix of logical and numeric class. 
#So logical class is coerced to numeric class making TRUE as 1.)   
c(TRUE,1) -> var.3           

print(var.1)
cat ("var.1 is ", var.1 ,"\n")
cat ("var.2 is ", var.2 ,"\n")
cat ("var.3 is ", var.3 ,"\n")

"Data Type of a Variable"
#In R, a variable itself is not declared of any data type, rather it gets the data type 
#of the R - object assigned to it. So R is called a dynamically typed language, which means that 
#we can change a variableâ€™s data type of the same variable again and again when using it in a program.

var_x <- "Hello"
cat("The class of var_x is ",class(var_x),"\n")

var_x <- 34.5
cat("  Now the class of var_x is ",class(var_x),"\n")

var_x <- 27L
cat("   Next the class of var_x becomes ",class(var_x),"\n")

"Finding Variables"
#To know all the variables currently available in the workspace we use the ls() function. 
#Also the ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.

print(ls())

#The ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.

# List the variables starting with the pattern "var".
print(ls(pattern = "var"))

#The variables starting with dot(.) are hidden, they can be listed using "all.names = TRUE" 
#argument to ls() function.

print(ls(all.name = TRUE))

"Deleting Variables"
#Variables can be deleted by using the rm() function. Below we delete the variable var.3. 
#On printing the value of the variable error is thrown.

rm(var.3)
#print(var.3)

#All the variables can be deleted by using the rm() and ls() function together.

rm(list = ls())
print(ls())
